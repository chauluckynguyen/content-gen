# Content Gen
Generating duplicate content can be a cumbersome task in Sketch. Let's move away from  the boring`Ctrl + C/V` and upgrade to an cooler method of randomly generated content!

## Usage

Let's start with the technical stuff...

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

To watch for changes:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Additionally, if you wish to run the plugin every time it is built:

```bash
npm run start
```
